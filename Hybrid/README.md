This directory contains code for variational autoencoder applied to 
collaborative filtering powered with movie embeddings/hand crafted movie features. 

Please look into the folder ./feature_extraction for the code on how to create movie features and learn movie embeddings from them.

Please look into the folder ./vae_imdb for the code on how to create a hybrid-VAE combining the movie embeddings learnt from imdb (best results) and user-ratings from movielens.
